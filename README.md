# Taeo's TFC API - Patched
- This version of Taeo's TFC API patches a bug players were encountering where Thaumcraft would crash the game whilst attempting to generate a desert biome.

If Taeo has any problem with this existing, please join the TerraFirmaCraft: Reloaded Discord server and make yourself known.
Otherwise, this is hosted purely for those who wish to use the mod without crashing.
